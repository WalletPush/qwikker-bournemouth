## Configuration

### **Environment Variables**
The Slack integration requires the following environment variable:

```bash
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/SLACK/WEBHOOK
```

### **Slack Webhook Setup**
1. Go to your Slack workspace
2. Create a new Slack App or use existing one
3. Enable Incoming Webhooks
4. Create a webhook for your desired channel
5. Copy the webhook URL to your environment variables

## Technical Implementation

### **Non-Blocking Design**
- Slack notifications are **non-blocking** - they won't fail file uploads if Slack is down
- Notifications run in parallel with GHL sync for optimal performance
- Error handling ensures user experience isn't affected by notification failures

### **Integration Points**

```typescript
// File upload flow with notifications
export async function updateProfileFile(userId, fileType, fileUrl) {
  // 1. Update Supabase profile
  await supabaseAdmin.from('profiles').update(...)
  
  // 2. Parallel external integrations (non-blocking)
  Promise.all([
    syncFileUpdateWithGHL(data, fileType, fileUrl),
    sendFileUploadSlackNotification(data, fileType, fileUrl) // ‚Üê New!
  ])
  
  return { success: true }
}
```

### **Message Structure**
Slack notifications use rich Block Kit formatting for better readability:
- **Header Block**: Clear notification type with emoji
- **Section Blocks**: Organized business information
- **Context Block**: Timestamp and metadata
- **Links**: Direct access to uploaded files

## Use Cases

### **Knowledge Base Maintenance**
- **New Menus**: Update AI training data with latest menu items
- **Logo Changes**: Update brand recognition systems
- **Offer Updates**: Keep promotional content current
- **Business Info**: Maintain accurate business profiles

### **Quality Control**
- **File Review**: Check uploaded content for accuracy
- **Data Validation**: Ensure business information is complete
- **Content Moderation**: Review files for appropriateness
