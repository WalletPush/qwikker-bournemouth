# ðŸš¨ GHL REDIRECT SOLUTION

## The Problem
GHL workflows can't redirect users based on webhook responses. The user stays on the form page after submission.

## The Solution
Use GHL's REDIRECT ACTION with the dashboard URL built from custom values.

## Step-by-Step Fix:

### 1. In your GHL workflow, AFTER the webhook action, add:
**Action Type**: Redirect
**Redirect URL**: 
```
https://qwikkerdashboard-theta.vercel.app/welcome?wallet_pass_id={{custom_values.serialNumber}}
```

### 2. Alternative: Use JavaScript Redirect in Form
Add this to your form's success message or custom code:
```javascript
// After successful form submission
const serialNumber = '{{custom_values.serialNumber}}';
window.location.href = `https://qwikkerdashboard-theta.vercel.app/welcome?wallet_pass_id=${serialNumber}`;
```

### 3. Test the Flow:
1. Submit form â†’ WalletPass created â†’ Custom values populated
2. Webhook fires â†’ Creates user in Supabase  
3. Redirect action â†’ Takes user to elegant welcome page
4. User clicks "Enter Your Dashboard" â†’ Shows personalized dashboard with name

## The Complete Flow:
```
Form Submit â†’ WalletPass API â†’ GHL Custom Values â†’ Webhook (our API) â†’ Redirect Action â†’ Welcome Page â†’ Dashboard
```

**The webhook and redirect happen in PARALLEL, not sequentially!**
